      <p className="info:">The watermarking algorithm employs various techniques to embed a robust watermark into audio files. One approach involves distributing the watermark across multiple frequencies, making it resistant to EQ-based removal and robust against compression and decompression. Another method incorporates infrasound, ultrasound, and subtle audible frequencies, creating a dynamic signature that can be amplified for detection. By strategically selecting frequencies and utilizing advanced algorithms, the watermark remains intact even under manipulation.

<h3>Value Proposition</h3>
<h4>Transparent Ownership Tracking:</h4>
    Transparent Ownership Tracking: Integrating watermarking into Polygon's blockchain offers transparent and permanent ownership tracking, allowing anyone to verify ownership and rights transactions, fostering a fair and open music industry.

<h4>Protection Against Audio Inflation:</h4>
     In an era of increasing AI-generated content, the technology assigns value and validation to human-created content, preserving its artistic value and ensuring fair recognition for composers, producers, and sound creators.
<h4>Fair Compensation Models:</h4>
     The technology enables new models to ensure creators receive fair compensation for their work. By directly linking ownership and rights information to an audio work via blockchain, creators can easily assert their rights and receive royalties or compensation based on usage.
<h4>Expanded Applications:</h4>
Beyond music, the technology has applications in film, radio, video games, and public environments, broadening market needs and potential applications, potentially evolving into a system that facilitates rights management and automation.
