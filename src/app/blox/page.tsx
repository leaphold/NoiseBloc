      <p>Blockchain technology utilizes cryptographic hash functions to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data. When an NFT is created, a hash of the digital asset's metadata is stored on the blockchain, serving as a digital fingerprint. This ensures data security by making it practically impossible to recreate original data from a hash.

imagine a world where every audio file has a unique digital fingerprint that can be traced back to its original creator. This is the vision behind NoiseBlocs, a revolutionary technology that combines blockchain and audio watermarking to protect audio files from unauthorized use and manipulation. By embedding a watermark throughout the audio file and linking it to the blockchain, NoiseBlocs ensures that creators can easily assert their ownership rights and receive fair compensation for their work.

We're pioneering a groundbreaking technology that directly integrates blockchain and NFTs into audio watermarking. By leveraging the blockchain network's hash generation capabilities, NoiseBlocs embeds a watermark throughout the entire audio file. This ensures that even a second of the audio can be recognized and linked to the blockchain, along with its rightful owner. This makes it significantly harder for unauthorized parties to manipulate or misuse audio files.</p>
